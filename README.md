# Football_Tournament_Database_Management
Final Project for the University Course "Database Systems"

The database for a football tournament is normalized to BCNF where necessary. Stored PL/SQL Procedures and Database Triggers are implemented to prevent data corruption. Indexes are introduced to the database tables to allow more efficient searching of data.
