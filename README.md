# Football_Tournament_Database_Management
Final Project for the University Course "Database Systems"

The database for a football tournament is normalized to BCNF where necessary. Stored PL/SQL Procedures and Database Triggers are implemented to prevent data corruption. Indexes are introduced to the database tables to allow more efficient searching of data. 

Files- 
  dbcreates: creates the database tables 
  dbload: loads the tables with data 
  dbdrop: drops all the tables 
  
  solution1: finds the funtional dependancies present in the tables which are used to detemine the normal form of the respective tables. 
  solution2: creates stored PL/SQL procedures and database triggers to prevent data corruption 
  solution3: determines the wait events of a distributed database 
  solution4: uses nested json query to implement data processing
